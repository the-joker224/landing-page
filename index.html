                    <img src="images/picture1.jpg" width="250" height="250">
                    <p>Heath Ledger’s Joker is the absolute embodiment of chaos, as well as a tour-de-force of acting. Ledger’s delivery of his lines, <br>as well as his movements and mannerisms, made him such an unsettling presence on-screen</p>

                    <img src="images/picture2.webp" width="250" height="250">
                    <p>Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker (aka Arthur Fleck) is a sympathetic and tragic villain <br> due to how he is wronged by society at a young age. Orphaned, abused, and poverty-stricken since day one,<br> Fleck is left to simmer in his misery without proper care and support until it all boils to the surface in an explosion of anger and violence.</p>

                    <img src="images/picture3.jpeg" width="250" height="250">
                    <p>Jared Leto’s Joker was soured by his questionable character design,<br> limited screen time, and somewhat cringey dialogue. His character can be somewhat forgiven<br> due to  studio interference in the production of Suicide Squad.</p>

                    <p>Who would’ve thought Luke Skywalker would be such a great villain? The legendary Mark Hamill found <br>his breakout role voicing the Clown Prince of Crime in the ’90s cartoon</p>
